# iMac G3 replacement parts
These files are an attempt at recreating some of the parts of an iMac G3 for a casemod.
My inner bezel shattered while disassembling, so a replacement was needed. 
I will also add mounting points for an LCD display.

This build is finished. Instructions and why not to do this can be found on hackaday.io: https://hackaday.io/project/160719-imac-g3-casemod

## Fork Information

If you are like me and looking to apply this to a later model iMac G3 DV model 400 or above, you need a couple additional parts to make this work. I had to add spacers for the bezel to fit the mounting screws as the designs above are too short, and a mount for the larger mic to fit into and mount. Note: I got lazy and just sanded the edges to match the curve for the mic mount though.
